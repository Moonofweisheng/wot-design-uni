# Join Communication Group

If you have questions, it's recommended to use `Github` for feedback. If platforms like `Github` can't solve your problem, you can join our groups. Please ensure your questions are clear and concise, and use polite and civil language. Thank you very much for your support!

## Communication Examples

Here are several communication examples that will help us understand which questioning methods are most likely to get problems solved.

### Incorrect Examples

**_Asking questions casually, not reading documentation, not providing reproduction demo, not providing detailed problem description, full of doubt and complaints, for example:_**

- Wrong Example 1: This button is ridiculous, `custom-class` doesn't work?
- Wrong Example 2: How can your component be so terrible? The `custom-class` attribute doesn't work, my custom styles don't take effect, can you fix it?
- Wrong Example 3: ? This component has a bug? My custom styles don't work???

### Correct Examples

**_After carefully checking the documentation and common problems and confirming the issue is unresolved, describe your problem in detail when asking questions, and provide a reproduction demo to help others investigate the problem. For example:_**

I encountered an issue where custom styles don't take effect when using the `Button` component's `custom-class` attribute. I've read the official documentation and common problems but still can't solve it. I've organized my minimal reproduction demo in a repository, could you help investigate the issue?
